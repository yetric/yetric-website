<h1 class="maintitle">We are <em>Yetric</em></h1>

<h2 class="subtitle">Data Driven User Experience</h2>
<!--img-->
<p class="lead">Building and growing your online products is all about knowing your numbers and data and working on stuff that matters. How do you <strong>acquire valuable leads</strong> to your product? How do you make sure that you have taught them all they need to know about your product when <strong>onboarding new users</strong>? How do you <strong>keep your customers engaged</strong> in your product and how do you <strong>retain customers</strong> that for some reason have stopped using your product.</p>

Yetric helps you and your team become data-driven and more iterative (faster, smaller and more iterations) in your efforts in order to be able to know where to put down your efforts and get most bang-for-the-buck. For us growth is the main thing, and we think you grow your business by knowing what your user wants and what turns them off.
