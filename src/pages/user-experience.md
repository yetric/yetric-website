## We Focus on User Experience

Knowing what your users love about your product and where they have problems using it can make a big difference in how you build and maintain your product online. By focusing on the User Experience and what value you add to your users you can make prioritization of features and resources easier and put the money to work where they have the best potential of making a good ROI. It is crucial that you set up the correct metrics and KPI:s for measuring the actual user experience within your product in order to be able to validate your efforts and prioritize upcoming work and features.

At Yetric AB we believe that using data, analysis and insights together with the mindset that the product exists in order to create the best possible value for the user is the best combination to create awesome products that will grow in both user numbers and revenue. As a product owner it is important to learn how the user use the actual product and act accordingly on that data.
