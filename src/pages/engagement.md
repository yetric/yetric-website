## User Engagement

Increasing engagement increases revenue and is a good measure on that your product is providing some sort of value for your users. By measuring the effects of your changes and doing proper testing of bigger changes before rolling them out to all your users, you can tune your engagement step by step, in a data-driven, iterative process where you learn by numbers what work, what does not work and most important, you put your effort where it is needed.
