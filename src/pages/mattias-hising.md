# Mattias Hising

I founded Yetric AB (first named Strategio, then 80 Ridge Street Media AB) in 2007. I am an "experienced" Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience. Worked at EA, DICE, King, Embark Studios, Ongame, bwin. Been in the gaming industry since 2005. Worked on 5+ AAA-titles for PC, Xbox and Playstation. 

Prefers Open Source over Proprietary Software. Libraries over Frameworks. 

Iteration and fast feedback loops is the key to building great software, not the perfect abstract architecture. 

Do not understand corp speek and has an ability to spot bullshit on first sight.

I prefer working in environments with diverse teams that focus on delivery and humor. I prefer humans that have a lot of self-distance. I am not a guru of anything but curious about a lot of things. Tends to work best when shit hits the fan and nothing is working.

I think title such as "Fullstack Developer", "Frontend Developer" and "Backend Developer" is bullshit.

I love building software that helps people achieve something or enabling them to understand something better.
